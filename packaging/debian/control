Description: Declarative network configuration tool for Linux
 Wire is a low-level, declarative, continuously-supervised network
 configuration tool for Linux. It combines the direct kernel access of
 iproute2 with the desired-state model of infrastructure-as-code tools,
 wrapped in a natural language CLI.
 .
 Features:
  - Direct netlink operation (no command wrapping)
  - Unified syntax (CLI = config file format)
  - Continuous supervision with drift detection
  - Built-in network analysis and diagnostics
  - Bond, bridge, VLAN, tunnel management
  - Traffic control and hardware tuning
